This repository contains the dataset of 250K Scratch projects as described in paper "A Dataset of Scratch Programs: Scraped, Shaped and Scored" ([preprint](http://swerl.tudelft.nl/twiki/pub/Main/TechnicalReports/TUD-SERG-2017-007.pdf)).

The dataset is available as:
* a MySQL database dump, in folder [/Dataset/mySQL/](Dataset/mySQL)
* an SQL Server database backup, in folder [/Dataset/SQL Server/](Dataset/SQL%20Server)
* CSV files, in folder [/Dataset/CSV files/](Dataset/CSV%20files) or on Gdrive: [/CSV files/](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B12xF-yva_Z4MVAzUHBXT0c0S2s). The version on Gdrive includes headers!



The JSON files of the scraped Scratch projects are available in GDrive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5RLHmerPR2SZ25XMWI5SGxhbTA/view?usp=sharing

The source files of the scraping program that we used for obtaining this information from the Scratch website are in the [/Scraper](Scraper) folder.
